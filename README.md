# 🚀 AlgoBounty — Decentralized Task Bounty Board on Algorand

AlgoBounty is a decentralized task marketplace built on the Algorand blockchain, enabling users to post bounties, claim tasks, submit proof of work, and receive rewards in a transparent, trustless, and automated manner. The platform eliminates intermediaries and introduces DAO-based dispute resolution, ensuring fair outcomes for all participants.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional freelancing or microtask platforms often:
- Charge high intermediary fees.
- Lack transparency in reward distribution.
- Have weak or biased dispute resolution systems.

**AlgoBounty** solves these by using blockchain technology to create a **transparent**, **fee-efficient**, and **community-governed** alternative.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Allow users to **post** tasks with reward amounts in ALGO or ASA tokens.
- ✅ Enable workers to **claim** tasks and **submit** proof of work via IPFS.
- ✅ **Automate** reward distribution using smart contract-based escrow.
- ✅ Offer DAO-based **dispute resolution** through on-chain voting.
- ✅ Integrate with DeFi protocols for optional yield farming & staking rewards (optional module).
